Review 3:


We agree that our problem definition could confuse the reader: the
paper (line 107) defines the problem as sampling from $p(x) =
2^{-|x|}/Z$ where $x\in X$ only if the program $x$ satisfies some
specification. This reviewer suggests $p(x)\propto 2^{-|x|} 1[x
satisfies specification]$, which we would change in our revision.
This would make the connection between the prior ($2^{-|x|}$) and
posterior more explicit.
