\section{High-level overview}

We want to sample programs from a description length prior.
Let $x$ be a program. Sample from
\begin{equation}
  P(x) = \frac{2^{-|x|}}{Z}
\end{equation}
Assume $|x|\leq n$ always, where $n$ is the number of SAT variables encoding the structure of the program.

The approach will draw from two techniques: (1) constraint-solving techniques for program synthesis; and (2) uniform solution sampling using XOR constraints.

The two most obvious approaches to this problem don't work:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Prefix codes}: Write down a prefix code for the space of allowed programs.
  Uniformly sample values of all $n$ SAT variables encoding the program structure;
  then the probability of sampling $x$ is proportional to $2^{n-|x|}$.
\item{Embed \& Project}: Introduce $n$ auxiliary variables, $A$,
  and add constraints $|x| > j\implies A_{j+1}$.
  Uniformly sample solutions to $(x,A)$.
  This is the technique introduced in ``Embed and Project'' (Stefano Ermon, 2013)
  \end{itemize}
